"""Bundle the editor into one self-contained HTML file: dist/pdf-editor.html.

The normal app (index.html) loads styles.css, app.js, export.js and the
vendor/ libraries as separate files. This script inlines all of them so the
editor can be shared or downloaded as a single file and opened by
double-clicking it.

qpdf (password support) is built in too, so the file works offline.

The pdf.js worker is inlined as a normal script. pdf.js notices it
(window.pdfjsWorker) and does its work on the page itself instead of in a
separate worker, which is a little slower on very large PDFs but needs no
extra file.

Run it again after changing any of the app's files:
    python3 build-single-file.py
